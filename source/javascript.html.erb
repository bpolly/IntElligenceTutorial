<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that can be used with HTML documents to provide a greater level of control and user interactivity to web pages.
 It has all of the basic capabilities of most high-level programming languages, as well as some features created specifically for the creation of web content.
 This tutorial will cover the basics of getting started in JavaScript programming, as well as resources for further learning. 
 As this JavaScript tutorial is dependent on HTML, please make sure you have reviewed our HTML/CSS tutorial.
<p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin using JavaScript, create a basic HTML document.
Make sure to review the <a href="htmlcss.html">HTML/CSS tutorial</a> if you are unfamiliar with how to do this.
The following line of code is used to link the JavaScript file to the HTML file:
<p>
<p><pre class="code">
<span class="code cl">1</span> <script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
</pre></p>
It will be included before your closing </body> tag, as shown below.
<p><pre class="code">
<span class="code cl">1</span> &lt;html&gt
<span class="code cl">2</span> &lt;body&gt;
<span class="code cl">3</span> &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
<span class="code cl">4</span> &lt;/body&gt;
<span class="code cl">5</span> &lt;/html&gt;
</pre></p>

<h2>Next Step</h2>

<p>Add the following JavaScript code to our example HTML file:<p>
____
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>JavaScript is capable of manipulating the content of our HTML document. 
In the example, we first selected the H1 element of our document, then we selected the Inner HTML. 
The Inner HTML is all of the content within the element we selected. 
We were then able to change the content of this element’s HTML by assigning it to ‘Hello, world&#33;’.
</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, variables are created with the following syntax:</p>

<p><pre class="code">
<span class="code cl">1</span>var exampleVar;
</pre></p>

<p>JavaScript has dynamic variable typing, meaning that the type of the variable can change throughout the script’s execution.
The chart below demonstrates the syntax for each of the types available in JavaScript.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
	<td>String</td>
		<td>var exampleVar &#61; ‘Hello’;</td>
		<td>JavaScript uses single quotes for strings</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Number</td>
		<td>var exampleVar &#61; 10; var exampleVar &#61; 5.87;</td>
		<td>JavaScript does not distinguish between different types of numbers (ie “Integers” or “Floats”)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Boolean
		<td>var exampleVar &#61; false;</td>
		<td>Booleans are true or false without quotes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Array
		<td>var exampleVar &#61; [1, 2, ‘A’, ‘B’];</td>
		<td>Arrays can have elements of any type. Elements are accessed with this syntax: exampleVar[0]</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Object
		<td>var exampleVar &#61; document.querySelector('h1');</td>
		<td>Almost everything in JavaScript is considered an object. This includes parts of the HTML document and functions.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>There are two different  formats for JavaScript comments. Both formats are common in other languages</p>
<p><pre class="code">
<span class="code cl">1</span> /*
<span class="code cl">2</span> This is a comment
<span class="code cl">3</span> */
<span class="code cl">4</span>
<span class="code cl">5</span> //This is a comment
</pre></p>

<h2>Operators</h2>
<p>JavaScript includes similar operators to other common languages, as well as functionality for strings.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>&#43;</td>
		<td>Concatenation, Add</td>
		<td>2 &#43; 5; &#34Hello &#34 &#43; &#34world&#33;&#34;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&#45;</td>
		<td>Subtract</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&#42;</td>
		<td>Multiply</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&#47;</td>
		<td>Divide</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>&#61;</td>
		<td>Assignment</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&#61;&#61;&#61;</td>
		<td>Identity</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&#61;&#61;</td>
		<td>Compare value</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&#33;, &#33;&#61;</td>
		<td>Negation, not equal</td>
	</tr>
</table>
